# Full tokenizer and Dockerfile
Initial release of pplox_web only supported single character tokens.
Updated to version 0.0.2 of pplox which supports all tokens in the Lox language.

On the infrastructure side, we Dockerized the application so it can run on any cloud.
For automation, we created a GitHub Action to build and push the Docker container for every push to the `main` branch.
