# Complete expression parser
With the release of pplox 0.0.4 we now have complete support for parsing expressions.
These expressions are parsed into a parse tree for evaluation, but currently expressions are not evaluated.

We support math expressions:
```
1 + 2 - 3
1 * 2 / 3
```

Comparisons between numbers are also supported:
```
1 < 2 <= 3
3 > 2 >= 1
```

And finally, equality checks between strings are now also parsed:
```
"foo" == "foo"
"foo" != "bar"
```

Next up, we will be working on evaluating these expressions.
